    | 25g         | starter     |
    | 100g        | water       |
    | 50g         | rye flour   |
    | 50g         | wheat flour |

## Mix
Mix all of the ingredients together.

## Store
Keep your little buddy in the fridge! When you feed a starter, collect the leftover in a separate container for use in discard recipes.

!!! tip "keep starters and discard in glass containers with loose-fitting lids to let air escape"

## When to feed
I've gone as long as a couple weeks between feedings. My guy is a little sleepy, I'm sure if I did more frequent feedings or feed twice before using, he'd be more energetic.
