## Mix Wet Ingredients
Combine wet ingredients a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment.

Run on lowest setting while measuring dry ingredients.

## Mix Dry Ingredients
Combine in a bowl and stir together. Add to the wet ingredients and run on lowest setting until just combined.

## Rest and Knead
Allow the dough to rest in a covered bowl for about 5 minutes. Then knead on the lowest setting for about 5 minutes.

!!! tip "The dough will be soft, smooth, and elastic"

## Bulk Prove
Transfer the dough to a straight-sided container with volume markings. Allow the dough to prove until it's volume has doubled (a couple hours).

## Shaping
Turn out dough on a lightly greased counter and deflate.

Weigh the dough on a kitchen scale.

Divide the dough into 18 equal pieces.

Roll each piece into a ball -- one-handed like you're a DJ disappointing your parents. The dough should spin under you palm, the bottom sticking to the counter. This should stretch the top of the dough taut while creating a little butthole on the bottom of the ball. Place it on a lightly floured surface or a cookiesheet.

Once all your little balls are lined up, give them about 5 minues to relax then smoosh them all down a bit.

## Prove
Cover the dough and let prove until they have doubled (about 30 minutes to an hour).

## Heat the oil
Fill a cast iron skilet with about an inch of oil.

Heat it on medium-low until it's about 350°.

!!! tip "oil temperature is critical"
    Do not let the oil get much over 350°. The outside of the donuts will burn and the inside will be raw.

## Fry
Use a fish-spatula to transfer 3 or 4 dough balls to the oil.

Fry on one side for a minute or two until it's crispy and golden.

Flip and fry on the other side for a couple minutes.

They're done when the internal temperature of the donut is above 190°.

Transfer to a wire rack (with a towel under it) to cool.

!!! tip "let the oil come back to temperature before doing the next batch"

## Add the sweet stuff
Glaze or toss in sugar & spices as soon as they are just cool enough to pick up.
