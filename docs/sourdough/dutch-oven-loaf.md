## Mix Wet Ingredients
Combine wet ingredients a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment.

Run on lowest setting while measuring dry ingredients.

## Mix Dry Ingredients
Combine in a bowl and stir together. Add to the wet ingredients and run on lowest setting for about 5 minutes.

## Rest and Stretch
Allow the dough to rest in a covered bowl for about 30 minutes. Then perform a series of stretches.

**Repeat this 3 to 10 times.**

## Bulk Prove
Transfer the dough to a straight-sided container with volume markings. Allow the dough to prove until it's volume has increased to 150% - 200% the starting volume.

## Pre-Shaping
Turn out dough on a lightly greased counter and use a bench scraper to stretch dough out into large rectangle.

Fold into thirds twice. First, folding in the left and right sides, then the top and bottom.

Flip the dough over and let rest for 20 minutes.

## Shaping
Use the bench scraper scoop/scoot the dough around like a little scamp. What a little rascal! Holding the scraper almost vertical, but slightly tilted away, push the dough away from you so that the leading edge sticks to the counter and is dragged under the dough. Repeat this on all four sides. The goal is to stretch the outer layer of the top of the dough so it's nice and taut. 

## Prove
Sprinkle the loaf with rice flour then transfer into a (rice) floured proving basket.

Prove the dough in the fridge for 24-48 hours.
