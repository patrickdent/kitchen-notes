Run on lowest setting while measuring dry ingredients. Mix Dry Ingredients Combine in a bowl and stir together. Add to the wet ingredients and run on lowest setting until just combined. Rest and Knead Allow the dough to rest in a covered bowl for about 5 minutes. Then knead on the lowest setting for about 5 minutes. The dough will be soft, smooth, and elastic Bulk Prove Transfer the dough to a straight-sided container with volume markings. Allow the dough to prove until it's volume has doubled (a couple hours). Shaping Turn out dough on a lightly greased counter and deflate. Weigh the dough on a kitchen scale. Divide the dough into 18 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball -- one-handed like you're a DJ disappointing your parents. The dough should spin under you palm, the bottom sticking to the counter. This should stretch the top of the dough taut while creating a little butthole on the bottom of the ball. Place it on a lightly floured surface or a cookiesheet. Once all your little balls are lined up, give them about 5 minues to relax then smoosh them all down a bit. Prove Cover the dough and let prove until they have doubled (about 30 minutes to an hour). Heat the oil Fill a cast iron skilet with about an inch of oil. Heat it on medium-low until it's about 350\u00b0. oil temperature is critical Do not let the oil get much over 350\u00b0. The outside of the donuts will burn and the inside will be raw. Fry Use a fish-spatula to transfer 3 or 4 dough balls to the oil. Fry on one side for a minute or two until it's crispy and golden. Flip and fry on the other side for a couple minutes. They're done when the internal temperature of the donut is above 190\u00b0.

Run on lowest setting while measuring dry ingredients. Mix Dry Ingredients Combine in a bowl and stir together. Add to the wet ingredients and run on lowest setting for about 5 minutes. Rest and Stretch Allow the dough to rest in a covered bowl for about 30 minutes. Then perform a series of stretches. Repeat this 3 to 10 times. Bulk Prove Transfer the dough to a straight-sided container with volume markings. Allow the dough to prove until it's volume has increased to 150% - 200% the starting volume. Pre-Shaping Turn out dough on a lightly greased counter and use a bench scraper to stretch dough out into large rectangle. Fold into thirds twice. First, folding in the left and right sides, then the top and bottom. Flip the dough over and let rest for 20 minutes. Shaping Use the bench scraper scoop/scoot the dough around like a little scamp. What a little rascal! Holding the scraper almost vertical, but slightly tilted away, push the dough away from you so that the leading edge sticks to the counter and is dragged under the dough. Repeat this on all four sides. The goal is to stretch the outer layer of the top of the dough so it's nice and taut. Prove Sprinkle the loaf with rice flour then transfer into a (rice) floured proving basket. Cover and prove the dough in the fridge for 24-48 hours. Preheat Oven to 450\u00b0 Put the dutch oven in the oven while it's preheating. Leave the dough in the fridge while you wait for the oven to come to temperature. Bake Remove the dutch oven from the oven and take off the lid. Gently flip the loaf onto a piece of parchment paper. Using a knife or a lame, slice some score marks on the top of the loaf. Transfer the loaf to the dutch oven. Spray the top of the loaf with some water and quickly replace the lid. Return to the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid, reduce the temperature to 400\u00b0, and bake for another 30 minutes. The bread is done when its internal temperature is between 205\u00b0 and 210\u00b0.","title":"Dutch Oven Loaf"},{"location":"sourdough/dutch-oven-loaf/#mix-wet-ingredients","text":"Combine wet ingredients in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment.
